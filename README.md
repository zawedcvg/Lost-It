**Motivation :**

Each day numerous items are lost. These losses can lead to panic and a lot of time is wasted in recovering the misplaced item.Â  For a university student while attending classes, meeting people at different places, and managing the busy college-life, the risk of losing items is very high. To prevent hassle in finding and retrieving the lost item, an online platform is deemed to be necessary and can help streamline the process. 

The platform would not only be convenient for university students, but also act as a rock where students can look out for their favorite items when helpless. 

**Aim :**

To help people recover lost items in the shortest possible time and most efficient manner through an online platform called Lost It. 

Our platform will serve mainly as a listing deck, where users can report/find their misplaced items. This listing would be visible to the public, allowing others to help find the item. Apart from that, the platform will allow users to create their own profile, track down their items, and get in touch with the person who might have found the item.
